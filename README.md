# ANOMALY-DETECTION-IN-FINANCIAL-TRANSACTIONS
This project builds a machine learning model for detecting anomalies in financial transactions to identify fraud. After preprocessing and feature engineering, Z-score, Isolation Forest, and Random Forest models are used. Random Forest achieved perfect results, with transaction amount as the key feature.
